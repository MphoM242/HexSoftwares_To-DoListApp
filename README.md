<h1>To-Do List app</h1>
Responsive and efficient web application by Mpho M.
<h2>About the Project</h2>
First project developed during my one-month internship as a Web Development Intern at HexSoftwares. It is a simple To-Do List app, created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
*It allows the users to add, update, remove, and mark tasks as completed. 
*It is very simple and easy to use, but I have included a help function to clarify how to use it, just in case.
*User gets alert messages: Indicating errors, successful operations, confirmation message before deletion and more, to keep the user up-to-date.

The data is stored locally using browser storage. A user's taks list data will remain even after the site and/ or the browser is closed.
