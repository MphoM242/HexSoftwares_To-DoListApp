<h1>To-Do List app</h1>
Responsive and efficient web application by <b> Mpho M. </b>  for <b> HexSoftwares </b> (Task 1- Project 2)
<h2>About the Project</h2>
First project developed during my one-month internship as a Web Development Intern at HexSoftwares. It is a simple To-Do List app, created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br/>
&emsp;*It allows the users to add, update, remove, and mark tasks as completed. <br/>
&emsp;*It is very simple and easy to use, but I have included a help function for clarity.<br/>
&emsp;*User gets alert messages: Indicating errors, successful operations, confirmation message before deletion and more, to keep the user up-to-date. <br/>
<br/>
The data is stored locally using browser storage. A user's taks list data will remain even after the site and/ or the browser is closed.
